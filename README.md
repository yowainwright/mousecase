# Mousecase

Mousecase provides the mouse support for touch or trackpad-like horizontal scrolling.
It is a no nonsense, 0 dependency JavaScript plugin that solves a simple usecase:

> Scrolling a horizontal plain with a mouse without using a scrollbar.

This behavior is expected on phones and with trackpads. Now, with Mousecase, the archaic computer mouse can keep up! Yay.
This utility can help remove the need to implement a slider or carousel thingy. Therefore, it basically saves lives,
Do you want to be saved? Great! Use Mousecase and become a happier engineer today.

## Why wouldn't I write these few lines of code myself?
