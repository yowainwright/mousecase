## Synopsis

Being able to horizontally scroll is a default behavior on phones and trackpads. 
With Mousecase, the archaic computer mouse can keep up! Yay. 

With MouseCase enabled, users can click down on their computer mouse and drag scrollable horizontal webpage content without a scrollbar. 
This utility can help remove the need to implement a slider or carousel thingy. Therefore, it basically saves lives.
